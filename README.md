# Mobile Price Range

The dataset contains data on 2000 mobile and their specifications. The price of a phone ended up a need in our daily lives and the price of that depends on diverse components which got to be consider.

Here, I have done some analysis related to mobile price range such as:
1. Predict the price range using Random Forest classification
2. Find out which features correlate with the price range using correlation matrix
3. Look for trend the price range based on ram, battery power, px_width, px_height, int_memory
4. Understanding customer preferences for different features and price points
5. Create market segment using K-Means clustering and Elbow method
6. Analyze segment characteristics
7. Create target specific customer groups
